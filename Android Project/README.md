## Data management
---
To Store data I used `Firebase` database. 


## Design Pattern
---

### Android
 `Fragment`, `Authentication`. Use `adapter` pattern to  load `recyclerview` data. 

### Server
Application backend server is built with `Nodejs` and `express`. Server side is developed using `MVC` Design Pattern. 



## Roadblocks
---
*Responsive UI* : While porting the UI from Figma has a huge downside. Figma's generated Android code is not enough to implement in real application. Exporting `drawble` doesn't solve the porblem. I had to write boiler plate `XML` code for each drawbles. To reduce the number of drawable, I use built in drawbles such as `checkbox`, `selector` etc. 

*Android Emulator* : Android Device emulator is obselute for development.. After a certain period of time, Emulator shows a dialog box `System UI`and stop working.
